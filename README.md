# Hidden-Moose-web
One of the main goals of this project (Lab 3) was to create a simple template and get a feel into how a website is created.
We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the three pillars of client-side web applications.
In the second part, we were able to incorporate React to make the system more interactive.
